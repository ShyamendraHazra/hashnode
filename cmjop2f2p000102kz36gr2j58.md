### **"Shyam is a developer who focuses on building clean, fast, and reliable websites and web apps. He works across both frontend and backend, and cares a lot about how things actually run under the hood.**

### **He works mainly on Linux and enjoys building things that feel solid, responsive, and well-engineered rather than flashy or fragile."**
